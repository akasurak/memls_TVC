===MEMLS configuration variables===

repo	report stuff?  (==verbose?)


===MEMLS variables===

All angles in radians

==prefix==
r*	reflected?

==postfix==
*d	sometimes for dry snow
*ii	imaginary? Dont confuse with *i which probably means real...

===MEMLS functions===
pfadc		calculates the effective path length in a layer
slred		locates and treats coherent layers in a snowpack
sccoeff		calculates the scattering coefficient from structural parameters
polmix		calculates the polarization mixing of the interface reflectivities of each layer (taking into account the first order scattering)
rt			calculates the layer reflectivity and transmissivity  
layer		calculates the upwelling brightness temperatures D (see Note 6 or Wiesmann and Matzler 1999)  


===MEMLS input file===
layer-number, temp [K], vol. fraction of liquid water, density [kg/m3], thickness [cm], Salinity (0 - 0.1) [ppt], expon.corr.length [mm]





===TODO===
sccoeff:
	*missing option for sccho=6
	*missing option for sscho=3
	*why use `whal` instead of sccho?
	*Change long if sequence to proper switch. (dangerous else at bottom)

run_MEMLS_Active_v2:
	*amemlsmain() ss0h=s0h/1.1, why?
